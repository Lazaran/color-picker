Controls:

Hover mouse over color gradients to change color

Top Bar : HUE
Right Bar : SATURATION
Left Bar : VALUE

The big square shows the main color, along with the RGB value for the color

The smaller square in the top left corner shows the inverse of the main color, along with its RGB value

This is not yet complete, the intention for this project is to be able to select a color and then copy its value ready for CSS, selecting the format from the menu on the right.
I have yet to implement the conversion method to for HEX and HSV output, the buttons to select copy type, and the copy button itself.
